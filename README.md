### Meet Lily, your professional Dank Player.

## About 
Hi, I'm Lily, and I'm a Dank Player. Just give me your account's access token, 
and your Discord channel link, and I'll play everything for you!

## What I can do:
- Beg: I regularly beg for money!  
- Fish: I can fish, and even defeat the boss's mini-games (with a few exceptions).  
- Highlow: I can play highlow! (But I'll just say high for everything.)  
- Hunt: I can hunt, and unlike my competitors, I can hunt for **DRAGONS**üê≤üê≤üê≤!  
- Search: I can search, and refuse to search in dangerous locations where you might die.  
- Work: I can work, solve all typing and memory mini-games.  
- Deposit: I regularly deposit your savings to the bank, to keep them safe and sound.  

And most importantly: **I learn from my mistakes!**. Whenever I fail a _Hangman_ or _Scramble_ mini-game,
I remember the answer, so that you (and other users) will never fail similar questions!

## My current weaknesses:
- I cannot work for more than two hours in a row, this would make Dank Memer angry! When my grandfather did
that, his boss's account got blacklisted!
- I cannot guarantee to play Hangman and Unscramble correctly! I'll learn over time, though.
- Sometimes, after I take a rest, my message queue gets clogged! The developers are working, and please
open an Issue if you find something wrong!
- I will not work correctly when used in a channel with multiple players! Create a private server,
just for you, me and Dank Memer.

## Privacy:
- I always respect your privacy, and will NEVER send any personal information, including, but not limited to, 
usernames, passwords, access tokens, that you've given me, or any messages that you've sent or received from 
your channel.
- I sometimes take note of questions and answers to mini-games of Dank Memer in my personal notebook. This data 
is always anonymous, and will only help to improve my Hangman and Unscramble skills.

## Terms of service:
I am provided for developers, for educational purposes only. I do not server the general public, to prevent
widespread spamming of channels.  
This means:  
- Do not spam the issues and forums for ways to get the access token. This is a basic stuff 
any developer, or computer geek who wants to become a developer, should know.
- Do not ask for precompiled binaries. Only the source will be distributed through the official
channel, as a developer you should know how to build it yourself.
- Do not open any issue without further diagnostics. These issues will simply be ignored. 

## Legal nonsense:
I am licensed under [The Root License](https://github.com/trungnt2910/RootLicense/blob/master/LICENSE.md). This basically means:  
- You can make clones of myself, modify them, and do whatever you want.  
- However, the developers should have the same rights to these clones, if you decide to 
distribute the source code.  
- The developers are not responsible if anything happens, so if Dank Memer blacklists your Prestige 100
account because of me, its your fault. Leave the poor developers alone.
